# a simple implementation of Facebook-messenger-bot 

this project was inspired with https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SyJNGsasXwo&pp=ygUTTHVjYXMgbWVzc2VuZ2VyIGJvdA%3D%3D 

I recommend  watching  the video first to get your cookies xd. 

This code  will receive  events from group chats such as adding participants,kicking,etc. 

available  commands:
1 ai <ask anything>
ai what is python 

2 bard <ask anything>
bard what is python
(bard can send images) 

3 pinterest <query -number of photos>
pinterest naruto -5 

4 lyrics  <song name>
Lyrics mundo 

5 brainly <query>
Note:brainly is not stable  and philippines  base
brainly statistics and probability 

# setup
Clone this  repo
Provide cookies to config
Run main.py 

That's it your good to go. 

Note:if you are having an error  while  logging in you can wait  for 3-10 seconds  and re run the program 

And if you logout your account  obviously  the cookies  will get destroyed  and  bot will not work   same as logging  in I guess .
